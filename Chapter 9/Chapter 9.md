## 9 Scheduling: Proportional Share

### Simulation

1. Just show seed 1: ![img](./images/1.png) ![img](./images/2.png)

2. ![img](./images/3.png)

   ![img](./images/4.png)

   Job 1 almost monopolizes CPU resources.

3. It's much more fair than the previous one.

4. With the increase of quantum size, the unfairness increases.

5. I don't want to make a graph. When job length is very large, it looks like a stride scheduler.
